## Handoff Instructions

### For Claude Sonnet:
1. Load this plan using the Read tool
2. Create todos based on the implementation tasks
3. Follow the technical approach outlined above
4. Update this document with completion status as you progress
5. Document any deviations or improvements discovered during implementation

### Model-Specific Considerations:
- This plan was created by Opus 4 with emphasis on architecture and design
- Sonnet should focus on efficient, practical implementation
- If clarification is needed, document questions for review
