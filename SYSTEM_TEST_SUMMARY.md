   - Configure persistent BOSS_AGENT_SECRET_KEY in .env
   - Fix system health endpoint

2. **Medium Priority:**
   - Optimize caching system performance
   - Add Anthropic Claude API key for full model coverage
   - Implement response time improvements

3. **Low Priority:**
   - Create monitoring dashboard
   - Add comprehensive logging
   - Implement advanced error handling

## 🚀 System Readiness

**Overall Status:** 🟡 **Operational with Minor Issues**

The CreatorMate multi-agent system is successfully running with core functionality working. The Boss Agent orchestration, model integrations, and specialized agents are all operational. Minor configuration and optimization issues need to be addressed for full system stability.
