npm audit --audit-level=moderate
python -m safety check

# 2. Static code analysis
bandit -r backend/
semgrep --config=auto frontend-nuxt4/

# 3. Security headers test
python scripts/security/test_api_keys.py --all
python tests/security/test_security_headers.py

# 4. Environment validation
python scripts/deployment/production_setup.py --validate-only

# 5. SSL/TLS configuration test
testssl.sh yourdomain.com

# 6. API security test
python scripts/security/api_security_test.py
```

5. **Implement containment** measures

#### Short-term Actions (15-60 minutes)
1. **Isolate affected systems** if necessary
2. **Gather evidence** for investigation
3. **Notify stakeholders** as appropriate
4. **Begin remediation** planning
5. **Update incident tracking**

#### Resolution Actions (1-24 hours)
1. **Fix security issues** identified
2. **Re-run security tests** to verify fixes
3. **Update documentation** as needed
4. **Conduct post-incident review**
5. **Update security procedures** if necessary
