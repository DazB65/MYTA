## Security Overview

### Security Architecture

MYTA implements a multi-layered security approach:

- **Application Layer**: Input validation, authentication, authorization
- **Network Layer**: HTTPS, CORS, rate limiting
- **Data Layer**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Secure hosting, monitoring, backups

### Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights
3. **Zero Trust**: Verify everything, trust nothing
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection
5. **Incident Preparedness**: Rapid response capabilities

## Incident Response

### Incident Classification

| Severity     | Description                     | Response Time | Examples                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Critical** | Immediate threat to system/data | 15 minutes    | Data breach, system compromise                |
| **High**     | Significant security impact     | 1 hour        | Authentication bypass, privilege escalation   |
| **Medium**   | Moderate security concern       | 4 hours       | Suspicious activity, failed security controls |
| **Low**      | Minor security issue            | 24 hours      | Policy violations, configuration issues       |

### Incident Response Process
