2. Rebuild frontend after fixes
3. Investigate the one failing agent (16.67% failure rate)
4. Consider setting up proper logging for error tracking
5. Implement automated health checks

## Conclusion

The Vidalytics application backend is healthy and operational. The frontend requires attention to resolve build issues. Once the TypeScript errors are fixed, the system should be fully operational.
